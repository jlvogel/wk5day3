// Intro to Flexbox & CSS Grid

//  As a front-end developer, you will be required to precisely
//  layout the elements on web pages.

//  Prior to Flexbox & CSS Grid, laying out the parts of a web
//  page from basic navigation headers to complex full-page
//  layouts has not been as straightforward as it could be -
//  Flexbox & Grid, however, are game changers.

//  The capabilities of Flexbox & CSS Grid complement each
//  other and using both side-by-side and even nesting one
//  within the other is possible.

//  The difference between Flexbox and CSS Grid is how they
//  are designed to lay out their children:

// Flexbox: One Dimension

// CSS Grids: Two Dimensions

// Flexbox

// Why Use Flexbox?

//  Flexbox excels at assisting devs with the following tasks:

//    Vertically centering content & elements within a container
//    element

//    Spacing child elements within a container uniformly

//    Making the height of child elements laid out in columns
//    the same even though they have a different amount of content.

// Flexbox Fundamentals

// We use a CSS display: flex; declaration to make an
// element a flex container, for example:

//    section {
//      display: flex;
//    }

//  The above would make all <section> elements flex
//  containers and all direct children become flex items.

//  Let's open a separate tab and briefly review what has
//  become the de facto guide to Flexbox:
